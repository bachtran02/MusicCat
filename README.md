# MusicCat

A Discord music-playing bot built with [hikari](https://www.hikari-py.dev/) and [lightbulb](https://hikari-lightbulb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). MusicCat uses [Lavalink](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/tree/master) as audio source and its plugins for additional features. 

### Invite the bot here: [Invite URL](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1055170653126398013&permissions=0&scope=bot)


## NOTABLE FEATURES:

* Intuitive Discord slash commands `/` support.
* `/search` - Search query autocompletion allows precise track lookup: 
	* `type` - type of query (track/artist/playlist/album).
	* `source` - search source to look up query (YouTube/YouTube Music/Spotify).

* `/player` - Interactive and persistent music player allows better control of playing music with buttons.

* `/effects` - add effects to your music (currently supports `Nightcore` and `Bass Boosted`).

* Personal music `play/pause` support - when the voice session only has you and the bot, Discord's `deafen` ðŸŽ§ pauses the player and `undeafen` resumes it.
* Sources supported: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/), [YouTube Music](https://music.youtube.com/), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/), and more [here](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/lavaplayer#supported-formats) 
* 24/7 Support :)
